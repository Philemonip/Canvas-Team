In this Canvas Project, we have the following functions:

- Simple drawing (pencil)
- Drawing bubbles
- Drawing furline
- Drawing straightline
- Drawing shadowline
- Drawing curve
- Drawing Emoji
- Textbox
- Eraser
- Shapes: circle, ellipse, square, rectangle, polygon
- Undo, Redo
- Clear All function

Division of labour:

Oscar - Shapes, Eraser, Clear all
Phil - Line drawing, Emoji, Undo Redo
Joel - Canvas common settings, configuration and all the layout designs of the Canvas

Challenges:

Shapes - Main issue is drawing the polygon, which takes sometime to figure out the logic behind. How I solved it, breaking down into smaller pieces and studied some online tutorial, which gave better insights.

Flood fill function - Planned to work on it, but found out it is much difficult than I thought, I do understand most of the logic but it takes quite some time to implement it. Decided to leave it later if we have time.

Line functions - Major challenge was working out the logic to implement the code for drawing furline and stamping the emojis. We were able to figure it out in the end through referencing available materials online and breaking down the codes into separate parts.

Textbox function - Spent considerable amount of time trying to fix the position of the text to correspond with the cursor position, but we were unable to solve it even after we took into account the size of the font for the printing of the text.

Undo, redo - Spent quite some time in debugging the function. In the end, figured out that we would need to initialize the background of the canvas first for the codes to work.
