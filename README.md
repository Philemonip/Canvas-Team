Shapes - Main issue is drawing the polygon, which takes sometime to figure out the logic behind. How I solved it, breaking down into smaller pieces and studied some online tutorial, which gave better insights.

Flood fill function - Planned to work on it, but found out it is much difficult than I thought, I do understand most of the logic but it takes quite some time to implement it. Decided to leave it later if we have time.
